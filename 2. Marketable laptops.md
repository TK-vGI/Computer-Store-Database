# Stage 2/4: Marketable laptops
## Description
You've discovered that laptops with at least 1000 GB of hard disk capacity and decent speed are selling well.  
Find out which manufacturer produces laptops with at least 1000 GB of disk size.

## Objectives
- Obtain a list of manufacturers (`maker`) that produce laptops with a hard disk (`hd`) space of at least **1000 GB**,  
  along with the speed (`speed`), the price (`price`), and the model (`model`) of those laptops;
- Find the `maker` and `model` of the `laptop` from the table `Product`, and the `hd`, `speed`, and `price` from the table `Laptop`.  
- Order output first by `hd`, then by **descending** order `speed`, and then by `price`.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:
The Electronic Store Customer Database encompasses four main tables: Laptop, PC, Printer, and Product.

In-depth details of each table are as follows:

`Product`** table stores information about manufacturers (maker), model numbers (model), and product types (type).  
- `maker`: Manufacturer of a product in the store.
- `model`: Primary key - unique across all manufacturers and product types.
- `type` : Product identification, one of 3 types available: laptop, printer, PC

`PC`** table contains information about each personal computer.
- `pc_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `cd` : CD reader speed such as DVD, Blu-ray, or None.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Laptop`** table contains information about each laptop.
- `laptop_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `screen` : Screen size in inches.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Printer`** table provides information about each printer model.
- `printer_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `color` : C for color printers, B for black printers.
- `type` : Printer types: Laser for laser printers, Inkjet for inkjet printers, Matrix for matrix printers.

## Example

_Laptop Table Example:_

| laptop_code | model | speed | ram | hd   | screen | price   |
|-------------|-------|-------|-----|------|--------|---------|
| 11          | 1001  | 3     | 8   | 500  | 13     | 999.99  |
| 13          | 4001  | 2     | 8   | 500  | 14     | 799.99  |
| 14          | 4002  | 4     | 16  | 1000 | 15     | 1199.99 |
| 15          | 1001  | 2     | 4   | 256  | 11     | 599.99  |
| 17          | 4001  | 4     | 16  | 1000 | 14     | 1099.99 |
| 18          | 4002  | 3     | 8   | 500  | 13     | 899.99  |

From the data presented in the table above, it is evident that laptops with `laptop_code` `14` and `17`  
have `hd` more than 1000 GB.
The output of the table after identifying:
                                                                 
| laptop_code | model | speed | hd   | price   |  
|-------------|-------|-------|------|---------|
| 14          | 4002  | 4     | 1000 | 1199.99 |  
| 17          | 4001  | 4     | 1000 | 1099.99 |  
 
_Product Table Example:_                                          
                                                                 
| maker     | model | type    |  
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Apple     | 1001  | Laptop  |  
| Dell      | 2001  | PC      |  
| Dell      | 2002  | PC      |  
| Lenovo    | 4001  | Laptop  |  
| Lenovo    | 4002  | Laptop  |  
| Canon     | 6001  | Printer |
| Epson     | 7001  | Printer |
| Microsoft | 9001  | PC      |
| Microsoft | 9002  | PC      |
                                     
The output after combining Laptop and Product table:

| maker  | model | hd   | speed | price   |  
|--------|-------|------|-------|---------|
| Lenovo | 4001  | 1000 | 4     | 1199.99 |  
| Lenovo | 4002  | 1000 | 4     | 1099.99 |  

_From the output above, it can be seen that the order of the columns is `maker`-> `model`-> `hd` -> `speed` -> `price`_
